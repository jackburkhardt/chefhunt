Welcome to this game that needs a proper title. You'll learn more background about the game itself once you start playing,
but it's essentially a "horror" "baking" "simulator" where you must collect ingredients and bake a cake before you get 
caught by French-Canadian chef Pol Martin (he's...a character). Also, it's completely dark and you only have a flashlight.

On screen, you will see tools (2d sprites) and ingredients (3d models). You'll also see a very tall Pol Martin running after you.
Follow the tasks on the top left. To complete them, find the mentioned object and "interact" with it by walking into it. You technically
have an inventory of stuff you've collected, but it's imaginary right now. If an object disappears, it means you've "picked it up".

NOTE: In the Game window (that comes up when you press Play), change the resolution at the top of the window from "Free Aspect" to "Full HD".
Otherwise you may notice visual issues, as this game was designed for 16:9 aspect ratios.

NOTE 2: If you start walking at a very very slow pace (you can tell, it feels like a crawl and it's hard to get away from Pol at the start)
then restart Unity. This seems to be some inconsistent Unity bug or something that I can't figure out the cause of.

Controls:
WASD - Move around (forward, left, right, backwards respectively)
Mouse - Look around
Collide/walk into object - Interact with object or pick it up

You win the game if you follow the instructions to bake the cake and pick it up before Pol Martin catches you. 
If he does run into you, you die. Pol's movement gets sligtly faster after you complete each objective.

Oh, one last thing: sometimes during the game Pol will enter a "frenzy" where he temporatily moves much faster. You'll know
when it happens.
